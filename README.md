 OOP Concepts Used

- ✅ Inheritance (`Admin`, `Customer` ← `User`)
- ✅ Polymorphism (virtual `showInfo()` function)
- ✅ Encapsulation (private fields, accessors)
- ✅ Operator Overloading (`==`, `>`, `<<`, `>>` if needed)
- ✅ File handling (`ifstream`, `ofstream`)
- ✅ Static members (if applicable)
- ❌ No `friend` functions (avoided due to outdated style)
