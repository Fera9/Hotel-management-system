 Hotel-management-system
Console app project for OOP2 course, Hotel Management system

A console-based hotel booking system developed in C++ using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and file handling. The system supports two types of users â€” Customers and Admins â€” with distinct roles and access levels. Data persistence is implemented through file I/O streams (ifstream, ofstream) without the use of databases or vectors.

 OOP Concepts Used

Inheritance: Room types such as OneBedRoom and TwoBedRoom are derived from a base Room class.
Polymorphism: Virtual methods like showInfo() allow dynamic binding for room information display.
Encapsulation: Data members are kept private with public getters and setters for secure data access.
Operator Overloading: Custom operators (==, >, <<, >>) are overloaded for meaningful comparisons and streamlined input/output.
File Handling: All user data, room data, and bookings are saved and loaded via file streams (.txt files).
